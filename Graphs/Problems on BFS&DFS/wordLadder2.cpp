//Problem Statement
/*
A transformation sequence from word beginWord to word endWord using a dictionary wordList is a sequence of words beginWord -> s1 -> s2 -> ... -> sk such that:

Every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter.
Every si for 1 <= i <= k is in wordList. Note that beginWord does not need to be in wordList.
sk == endWord
Given two words, beginWord and endWord, and a dictionary wordList, return all the shortest transformation sequences from beginWord to endWord, or an empty list if no such sequence exists. Each sequence should be returned as a list of the words [beginWord, s1, s2, ..., sk].

*/
/*Approach- 
Initialize Data Structures:
1.Convert wordList into an unordered_set for O(1) look-up time.
2.Create a queue q to store paths and initialize it with the beginWord.
3.Use usedOnLevel to track words visited at each level and prevent revisiting them.
4.Initialize a vector ans to store all the valid sequences that lead from beginWord to endWord.
5.Start BFS with level set to 0.

BFS Traversal:
1.For each level, check if the current word's transformation is at a new level by comparing vec.size() with level.
2.If at a new level, clear the usedOnLevel and update level.
3.For each word in the queue, if it equals endWord, store the sequence (since itâ€™s a valid transformation path).
4.For every word, generate all possible transformations by replacing each character with a-z and check if the transformed word exists in the set. If it exists:
-Add the transformed word to the current path.
-Push the path to the queue for further processing.
-Mark the word as visited on the current level by adding it to usedOnLevel.

Termination:
BFS terminates when all paths are explored, and we return all the valid transformation sequences stored in ans.
