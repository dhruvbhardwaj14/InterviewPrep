//Problem Statement
/*There are n servers numbered from 0 to n - 1 connected by undirected server-to-server connections forming a network where connections[i] = [ai, bi] represents a connection between servers ai and bi. Any server can reach other servers directly or indirectly through the network.

A critical connection is a connection that, if removed, will make some servers unable to reach some other server.

Return all critical connections in the network in any order.*/
/*Approach- 
USE DFS ALGO
-tim[]-> tracks the time of insertion of a node in DFS
-low[]->min time of insertion from all adjacent nodes apart from parent
