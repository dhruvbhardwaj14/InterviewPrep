size of data bits
int- 32 bits (31st bit is reserved for sign)
long long - 64 bits

how to store -13
-- write 13 in binary= for sign->(0) 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1
-- store in 2s compliment form = 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1

left shift << on INT_MAX gives overflow

Not(~) operator
1. flip the number bits
2. if it is negative then store it in 2's compliment manner
ex-1 ~(5)
~(0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1)
({1} 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 )-> yes it is negative since sign changed so two's compliment it
({1} 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0)-> (-6) computer will store

ex-2 ~(-6)
~({1}  1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 0)
 ({0}  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 1)-> not negative so this is the answer only
